#FlightRoutes

This was an assignment from CS242. Functionality includes finding shortest flights paths between two cities, accessing statistical info like population, region, and timezone for major cities, and creating custom cities and routes which can then be exported as a JSON file. All routing and statistical info is obtained by parsing the given JSON file.

To run the program: python main.py

To run the tests: python -m unittest -v test
